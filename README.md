# README

An app I shitcoded while trying to learn a bit of go and svelte while checking software dev frameworks. Don't judge to harsh

Select a folder, will read all the images -> map them of json
Uses that json to store tags to each image

## About

This is the official Wails Svelte template.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## Todo
1. Fix error passing
   1. OS.exit if bad error
   2. Continue in loop if nothing burger
2. Add links to images that will be store in json# meme-folder-wails-svelte
